<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Abraham G. Taye</h1>
<h3 align="center">Biomedical Engineer | Machine Learning | Medical Imaging Researcher |
</h3>
<p>
Biomedical engineering graduate student and liaison, specializing in computational and medical image processing, with a strong focus on pulmonary function and acute lung injury (ALI). My research involves developing and validating models to study the pathogenesis of ALI across molecular, cellular, and organ levels, integrating experimental and functional imaging (optical, SPECT) results to enhance the understanding of research. I also work on with CT, MR, and SPECT imaging for toxicity quantification, segmentation, and multi-modal image registration. I am deeply passionate about harnessing AI/ML, computer vision, and computational modeling to advance the understanding and treatment of complex pathophysiological conditions.
