<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Abraham G. Taye</h1>
<h3 align="center">Biomedical Engineer | Medical Imaging Researcher |
</h3>
<p>
Biomedical Engineering graduate student and imaging researcher, working with in nuclear imaging, detector systems, and computational modeling. I focus on SPECT and CT imaging, developing and validating models for photon transport, image reconstruction, and collimator/detector performance. My research integrates experimental and functional imaging data to quantify physiological processes and optimize imaging system design.
