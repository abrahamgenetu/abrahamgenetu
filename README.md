<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Abraham G. Taye</h1>
<h3 align="center">Biomedical Engineer | Machine Learning | Medical Imaging Researcher |
</h3>
<p>
Biomedical Engineering graduate student and imaging research specialist, with expertise in nuclear imaging, detector systems, and computational modeling. I focus on SPECT and CT imaging, developing and validating models for photon transport, image reconstruction, and collimator/detector performance. My research integrates experimental and functional imaging data to quantify physiological processes and optimize imaging system design. 

Experienced in multi-modal image registration, segmentation, and quantitative analysis, I leverage AI/ML and computational simulations to evaluate imaging system metrics such as sensitivity, spatial resolution, uniformity, and septal penetration. Passionate about advancing nuclear imaging hardware and software, I aim to contribute to innovative SPECT/PET system development and optimization for improved clinical outcomes.
